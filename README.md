**tl;dr**  ColBERTer is a neural retrieval model using contextualized late interaction (ColBERT) with enhanced reduction. ColBERTer fuses single-vector retrieval, multi-vector refinement, and optional lexical matching components into one model. For its multi-vector component, ColBERTer reduces the number of stored vectors per document by learning unique whole-word representations for the terms in each document and learning to identify and remove word representations that are not essential to effective scoring.

## Pre-Trained Models

We provide the following full-trained 6 layer DistilBERT-based models via the HuggingFace model hub:


* **ColBERTer<sub>CLS:128,BOW<sup>2</sup>:32</sub>** https://huggingface.co/sebastian-hofstaetter/colberter-128-32-msmarco

    This instance is trained on MSMARCO-v1, using contextualized stopwords (and removes around 29% of the whole-words), the BOW<sup>2</sup> component matches all words per document (no exact matching enabled).
    
    For a minimal usage example of the ColBERTer model check out  [our notebook here](minimal_colberter_usage_example.ipynb) or [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sebastian-hofstaetter/colberter/blob/master/minimal_colberter_usage_example.ipynb)

* **Uni-ColBERTer<sub>CLS:128,BOW<sup>2</sup>:1 with EM</sub>** https://huggingface.co/sebastian-hofstaetter/uni-colberter-128-1-msmarco

    This instance is trained on MSMARCO-v1, using contextualized stopwords (and removes around 50% of the whole-words), the BOW<sup>2</sup> component matches only exact word-matches between query & document.
    
    For a minimal usage example of the Uni-ColBERTer model check out  [our notebook here](minimal_colberter_usage_example.ipynb) or [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sebastian-hofstaetter/colberter/blob/master/minimal_colberter_usage_example.ipynb)


## BOW<sup>2</sup> Bag of Whole-Words

A main contribution of ColBERTer is the aggregation from sub-words to unique whole-words. This is accomplished with a new [BOW2Tokenizer](bow2_tokenizer.py) (which wraps a HuggingFace tokenizer) and a few lines of pytorch code. This technique is definitely not limited to the ColBERTer architecture, and could potentially be build into many other models. Therefore, we provide a minimal usage example, that shows how to use the tokenizer + the aggregation code only: [bow2_tokenizer_example.ipynb](bow2_tokenizer_example.ipynb)

*Here, we aggregate into a bag of whole-words, where 1 word only appears 1 time in the output -> the tokenizer could easily be changed to keep the positions of whole words intact, if that is necessary.*

*Update with ColBERTer code coming soon*

<!--We have getting started guides for training teachers & students, as well as a range of other possibilities for dense retrieval training.
